# Travel Circuit
We all deserve a get-away, we make it easy to travel here at Travel Circuit! Just pick a destination, date, guest amount, and days you want to stay and we will take care of the rest.

## Learning Goals
- Implement ES6 classes that communicate with each other using created data structure.
- Use object/array prototype methods to manipulate data.
- Create a dashboard that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way.
- Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP.
- Implement a testing suite using TDD for our data structure.
- Work with a local server and make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data.
- Write multiple API calls

## Overview of Project
- Travel Ciruit is an app where you can view previously planned trips, and request new trips from Travel Ciruit.

## Setup

 - Clone down this repo.
 - `cd` into directory
- run `npm install` to install project dependencies
- run `npm start` to start server


- Additionally, we will need to run the data server:
- Clone [this local server](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api) down to your machine. Not into the same directory!
- run `npm install` to install project dependencies
- run `npm start` to start server
- After ensuring that both servers are running, the FitLit app should be fully operational at http://localhost.8080
